Remember to comment your code! It will make it easier for the next person to understand.

I would recommend having the filepaths as variables so that you minimize the chance of typing it wrong and causing errors.

Try to clean up your try catches to be more organized/easy to read.

Iteration Two:
1. It looks like your createWaypoints() in UnitManager has a lot of hardcoding in it. See if there's a cleaner way to set up the waypoints.
2. Make sure to get rid of commented out code that you're not using anymore.
3. You have some good comments in your code. Just try to make sure that it's done consistantly throughout.
